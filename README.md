# README
Code for the experiments in *Two Tales of Single-Phase Contrastive Hebbian Learning* ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08573), [ICML link](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/32812)).

The deep conv-net experiments with $DP^\top$ can be run from the bash_scripts folder. The environment requirements are listed in requirements.txt.

The MLP experiments assesing Lipschitz properties of DP variations are implemented in the julia script train_DP.jl.
